                    I am a 23 year old Memphian who has taken both the Code 1.0 and Web Programming courses at TECH901, which has given me exposure and experience in Python, C, C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </li>

                <li>
                    My interest in programming began with videogames, but has grown greatly since taking classes at TECH901 to the point that I am pursuing a career in the field. I want to add many different weapons to my arsenal so that I may be better suited for my new career and also work on my passion project, creating a game with a friend of mine.
